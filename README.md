# LLM-AccelGo
Developed LLM AccelGo, a GPU performance-boosting framework using Go, CUDA, and TensorRT on DigitalOcean GPUs. Implemented LoRA, FP16/INT8 quantization, and 8-bit optimizers, achieving 2Ã— faster training and lower VRAM use. Deployed optimized inference via Go REST API with distributed multi-GPU scaling.
